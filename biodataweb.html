			<h2 class="major">Tsuki adventure</h2>
			<p>This game is not like your typical game,because the game play its just logging in and waiting for tsuki the rabbit to do something, so you would log in diffrent time in a day and just watch him do his thing, what make this spesial is the character intreraction/ friendship and the diary entry so fun to collect. also music so calming. achieving golden heart with ken,momo and yori is so nice also sherif inu yall <3</p>
